A. Preliminary Steps

create table MatchData(Batsman string, Bowler string, Prob0 decimal(10,5), Prob1 decimal(10,5), Prob2 decimal(10,5), Prob3 decimal(10,5), Prob4 decimal(10,5), Prob6 decimal(10,5), ProbNO decimal(10,5))

create table BowlClust10(Player_Name string, Econ decimal(10,5), SR decimal(10,5), Cluster int)

create table BatClust10(Player_Name string, Avg decimal(10,5), SR decimal(10,5), Cluster int)

To find Cross Product of Bowlers with Batsmen -
select a.Player_Name as Batsman,b.Player_Name as Bowler,a.Cluster as Batting_Cluster,b.cluster as Bowling_Cluster from batclust10 a, bowlclust10 b;

To combine Match Data with above cross product (TOO COMPUTATIONALLY EXPENSIVE) -
select * from (select a.Player_Name as Batsman,b.Player_Name as Bowler,a.Cluster as Batting_Cluster,b.cluster as Bowling_Cluster from batclust10 a, bowlclust10 b) natural join matchdata;

B. Player to Player Probabilites with their cluster numbers -

select c.Batsman,c.Bowler,c.Batting_Cluster,d.Cluster as Bowling_Cluster,c.Prob0,c.Prob1,c.Prob2,c.Prob3,c.Prob4,c.Prob6,c.ProbNO from ((select a.Batsman,a.Bowler,b.Cluster as Batting_Cluster,a.Prob0,a.Prob1,a.Prob2,a.Prob3,a.Prob4,a.Prob6,a.ProbNO from ((select * from matchdata) a) join batclust10 b on a.Batsman=b.Player_Name) c) join bowlclust10 d on c.Bowler=d.Player_Name;

C. Cluster to Cluster Probabilities -

select e.Batting_Cluster,e.Bowling_Cluster,avg(e.Prob0),avg(e.Prob1),avg(e.Prob2),avg(e.Prob3),avg(e.Prob4),avg(e.Prob6),avg(e.ProbNO) from ((select c.Batsman,c.Bowler,c.Batting_Cluster,d.Cluster as Bowling_Cluster,c.Prob0,c.Prob1,c.Prob2,c.Prob3,c.Prob4,c.Prob6,c.ProbNO from ((select a.Batsman,a.Bowler,b.Cluster as Batting_Cluster,a.Prob0,a.Prob1,a.Prob2,a.Prob3,a.Prob4,a.Prob6,a.ProbNO from ((select * from matchdata) a) join batclust10 b on a.Batsman=b.Player_Name) c) join bowlclust10 d on c.Bowler=d.Player_Name) e) group by e.Batting_Cluster,e.Bowling_Cluster order by e.Batting_Cluster asc,e.Bowling_Cluster asc;

Steps (Starting from the innermost query) -
1. Get the Player to Player Probabilities from the files in Step 1.
2. Join each entry with the batting and bowling cluster tables to get the cluster numbers for each batsman-bowler combination.
3. Using aggregation operations such as average, we find the cumulative average probabilities for every cluster to cluster combination. In this case as we have 10 clusters, we get 10 * 10 = 100 combinations.
